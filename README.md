Simple tool to format text into separate Notion blocks. Just paste your text, and copy the output to your Notion.  
It adds two spaces before each hidden newline character (\n), which tells Notion to end current block.

**PS.** Since there’s no way to create truly empty blocks, I’ve decided to use period (`.`) as a placeholder

Here is simple example of how it works
