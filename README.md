Simple tool to format text into separate Notion blocks. Just paste your text, and copy the output to your Notion.  

How it works: It adds two spaces before each hidden newline character (\n), which tells Notion to end current block.

**PS.** Since there’s no way to create truly empty blocks, I’ve decided to use period (`.`) as a placeholder
